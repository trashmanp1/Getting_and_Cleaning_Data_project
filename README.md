# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The main pourpose of the project is: 
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.                                                     
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.                           
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.                                           
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.                                                
 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
 In short: creates a dataset with subject id;activity label; mean and std related data.

There are 3 files in this repository
README.md this file

run_analysis.R a script that clean and tidy the data and creates a dataset with:
subject id;activity label; mean and std related data.   

code_book.md A file that describes how the program works and output data is organized.
